Guess the Follower Count Game

Description
This is a simple Python game where players guess which of two accounts has more followers. The game uses random accounts from a predefined dataset and displays their details, such as name, description, and country. Players are prompted to guess which account has more followers, and their score is tracked based on correct answers.

Concepts Applied
This project demostrate severak key python concepts, including:
1. Random module. The random.choice() function is used to randomly select an account from the provided data, adding unpredictability yo the game.
2. Dictionaries. The game makes use of dictionaries to store account details (e.g., name, description, country, followers_account). This is an example of how to structure and retrive data using Python dictionaries.
3. Functions. Demostrate a modular programming and how functions can be used to organize and reuse code.
4. Loops. To repeatedly run the game.
5. Conditionals. To decide the flow of the game
6. String Manipulation. To insert data into readable string format for display.
7. Data Structure. Accounts data is stored in a list of dictionaries, and the game processes this data by accessing and manipulating the values of each account's details.
